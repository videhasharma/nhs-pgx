# Apperta NHS Pharmacogenomics data models reviews

## Introduction

This project aims to build and publish a number of open data models for the storage of pharmacogenomics data. We are using the 'openEHR' standard for this, with a view of standardise pharmacogenomic data so healthcarer providers can implement clinical decision support systems and personalise the prescribing of medicines at scale. This short animation explains the rationale for the project.

Once reviewed and validated by an international community, including input from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), the model will be published by openEHR International.

## openEHR archetypes and templates

If you are not familiar with openEHR, this short intro may be helpful - watch until about 15m 20s.

Archetypes are definitions of components of information to be stored in a healthcare record or application. For example how to record a blood pressure, or a diagnosis, or a specific PROM like EQ-5D.

###
The non-profit openEHR community works directly with clinicians and other health and care professionals to define and then freely share the archetypes and templates, using tools that non-engineers can use to create and review the archetypes.

## Reviewing archetypes

Building archetypes is normally done by clinical informatics but they need to be reviewed by specialists in the subject, in this case, people with a knowledge of Pharmacogenetics.

We use a special tool called 'Clinical Knowledge Manager' for this purpose, inviting people to review the archetype on-line.

The CKM tool we are initially using for this project is hosted by Apperta on behalf of openEHR UK, specifically for UK-based projects.

You will receive a specific email invitation to participate as a reviewer. There is absolutely no cost and we promise not to hassle you with too many reminders - you can opt out at any point.

The process is straightforward but you might find it helpful to watch this [Video walk-through](https://vimeo.com/842865092?share=copy) of what is involved.

This [Reviewing archetypes](./CKM-001-%20Reviewing-an-Archetype-on-CKM.md) page might also be helpful.

When reviewing archetypes, remember that these are not 'forms' as such - they are definitions of the information that sits beneath, so don't worry about the exact appearance.
